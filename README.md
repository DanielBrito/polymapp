**PolymApp** is a (very) personal management tool to control readings and studies, make long-term activity plans, budget to measure expenses, list ongoing and future projects, and other features.

It's an optimized version of a spreadsheet that I used to perform such activities since I was 16. Moreover, it's also an opportunity to improve my programming skills and increase my knowledge in software engineering.

The name is inspired by the term _polymath_, who is an individual whose knowledge spans a significant number of subjects.

## Functionalities

📚 READINGS: List of ongoing and future readings (books, magazines, mangas, comics etc.). Thus, I can measure the number of readings I make in a year, for example.

🔍 RESEARCHES: As a person who is interested in a lot of subjects, one day I lost total control of what I was studying because I couldn't manage all the stuff I was getting into (at the same time). So, this list helped me to get back on track.

💡 CREATIVITY: List of actions, positive thoughts and quotations that makes me reflect on my existential purpose and helps me to create stuff.

🌐 WEB SITES: List of my favorite web sites where I read about art, politics, science, technology, philosophy and other interesting subjects.

📅 LONG TERM: List of activities to be scheduled and completed in the long term.

🧠 LEARNING: My self-learning revolves around this list, which has the programming languages I'm learning, the ones I want to study, as well as languages (French, Spanish, Italian) and many, many other things.

🛠️ PROJECTS: List of projects I'm involved in and intend to develop.

✅ AGENDA: List of daily activities. I don't stipulate time, because everything is so unpredictable, I just write down all the goals and try to complete them.

👨 PROFILES: List of all accounts I own, including the link and the specification of each one.

📺 WATCHING: List of movies, documentaries, series and animes I'm watching as well as the ones I plan to watch.

💰 EXPENSES: Since I earned my first salary, I control my monthly expenses and make a budget for things I want to buy (mostly books).
