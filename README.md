    <strong>PolymApp</strong>
</h1>

**PolymApp** is a (very) personal management tool to control readings and studies, make long-term activity plans, budget to measure expenses, list ongoing and future projects, and other features.

It's an optimized version of a spreadsheet that I used to perform such activities since I was 16. Moreover, it's also an opportunity to improve my programming skills and increase my knowledge of UI/UX Design and Software Engineering.

The name is inspired by the term _polymath_, who is an individual whose knowledge spans a significant number of subjects.

## Features

:books: **READINGS:** List of ongoing and future readings (books, magazines, mangas, comics etc.).

:mag: **RESEARCHES:** As a person who is interested in a lot of subjects, one day I lost total control of what I was studying, because I couldn't manage all the stuff I was getting into (at the same time). So, this list helped me to get back on track.

:bulb: **TIPS:** List of actions, positive thoughts and quotations that makes me reflect on my existential purpose and helps me to create stuff.

:calendar: **LONG-TERM PLANS:** List of activities to be scheduled and completed in the long term.

:brain: **LEARNING TOPICS:** My self-learning revolves around this list, which has the programming topics that I'm learning, the ones I want to study, as well as languages (French, Spanish, Italian) and many, many other things.

:hammer_and_wrench: **PROJECTS:** List of projects that I'm involved in and intend to develop.

:ballot_box_with_check: **APPOINTMENTS:** List of daily activities. I don't stipulate time, because everything is so unpredictable. I just write down all the goals and try to complete them.

:tv: **WATCHING:** List of movies, documentaries, series and animes that I'm watching as well as the ones I plan to watch.

:moneybag: **EXPENSES:** Since I earned my first salary, I control my monthly expenses and also make a budget for things I want to buy (mostly books).
